# üß† Proposal: Reincarnator  
**A Modular Swarm Agent for Detecting Smart Contract Reincarnations on Solana**  
*Built with the Eremos Agent Framework*

---

## Overview

**Reincarnator** is a behavioral detection agent designed to track **recycled smart contracts**, **reactivated high-risk wallets**, and **coordinated scam relaunches** on the Solana blockchain. 

This agent leverages **compound pattern detection** ‚Äî combining contract fingerprinting, wallet dormancy analysis, airdrop funneling, and metadata mutation recognition ‚Äî to surface high-confidence early signals of on-chain threat recurrence.

> üîç **Key Idea:** The most dangerous smart contracts aren‚Äôt always new ‚Äî they‚Äôre often old code in new wrappers, deployed by wallets that disappeared and reemerged.

---

## Motivation

Solana‚Äôs environment makes it uniquely vulnerable to **scam reincarnation**:

- ‚ö° **Low deploy cost** enables endless iteration by bad actors
- ü´• **Pseudonymous wallets** make historical linking hard
- üöÄ **Retail FOMO** drives high inflow into unaudited tokens
- ‚è≥ **Rugs recycle** ‚Äî often by dormant wallets or copycat deploys

Yet no public tool today *proactively* detects when previously malicious or dormant actors redeploy slightly modified versions of known scams.

**Reincarnator** fills this gap.

---

## Objectives

- ‚úÖ Detect recycled smart contracts with ‚â•95% similarity to known malicious or suspicious code
- ‚úÖ Surface deployer wallets that have been dormant for ‚â•90 days or tied to past scams
- ‚úÖ Flag airdrop claimers funneling to the same centralized wallet or CEX deposit address
- ‚úÖ Catch duplicate token deploys that differ only by minor metadata (e.g., symbol, supply)
- ‚úÖ Emit real-time alerts for dashboards, firewalls, or public transparency feeds

## Detection Architecture

### üß† **Behavioral Patterns Tracked**

| Behavior | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Code Cloning | Detect near-duplicate smart contracts using fingerprinting |
| Wallet Reawakening | Flag re-deployments from long-dormant or risk-associated wallets |
| Metadata Mutants | Identify redeploys of the same logic with only cosmetic metadata changes |
| Airdrop Funnels | Monitor mass airdrop claim wallets funneling to a common wallet/CEX |
| Compound Triggers | Only emit alerts when multiple suspicious traits overlap |

---

## Technical Design

### Modular Integration with **Eremos Agent Framework**

| Function | Module |
|---------|--------|
| Code Fingerprinting | `CodeSimilarityModule` (AST/Wasm diffing) |
| Dormant Wallet Profiling | `WalletActivityModule` |
| Risk Attribution | `WalletProfiler`, `FundingSourceModule` |
| Airdrop Funnel Tracking | `AirdropFlowAnalyzer` |
| Metadata Clone Detection | `TokenDeployNormalizer` |
| Alert Engine | `SwarmAgent` |
| Output Formatting | `SignalReporter`, `SeverityScorer` |
